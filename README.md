# Store-Marks
This project is a Student Marks Management System developed using Python.
It allows teachers to create student IDs, enter subject-wise marks, and view the student list.
Students can securely log in using their roll number and name to view their marks, total score, and percentage.
The system uses Python dictionaries for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring accuracy and simplicity.
It is a console-based application designed to demonstrate basic concepts of data structures, functions, and conditional logic in Python.
